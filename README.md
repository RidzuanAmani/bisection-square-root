# Bisection Square Root

A Python implementation of the bisection method to approximate square roots, built for freeCodeCampâ€™s Scientific Computing with Python certification. Demonstrates numerical methods, iteration, and precision handling.

## Features
- Approximates square roots of positive numbers using the bisection method.
- Handles edge cases (e.g., negative numbers, zero).
- Interactive input for testing.

## What I Learned
- Bisection method for numerical root-finding, similar to optimization in Merge Sort.
- Iterative precision control, inspired by Arithmetic Formatter.
- Error handling, drawn from Luhn validation.
- User input testing, like in Probability Calculator.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RidzuanAmani/bisection-square-root.git`
2. Run the script: `python bisection_square_root.py`
3. Enter a number (e.g., 16) to see its square root (e.g., ~4.0000).
